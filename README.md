# Polynomial-Regression-From-Scratch

## Objective
The goal of this project is to understand how polynomial regression works.
During this experiment, we will solve the polynomial regression problem with two different methods:
- using the Normal Equation
- using Gradient Descent

## Blog Post

## Setup
In order to install the conda environment needed to run the notebook, run the following line:
```console
conda env create --file requirements.yml
conda activate torch
```
