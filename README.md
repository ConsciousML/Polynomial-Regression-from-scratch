# Polynomial-Regression-From-Scratch

## Objective
The goal of this project is to understand how polynomial regression works.
During this experiment, we will solve the polynomial regression problem with two different methods:
- The normal equation
- Gradient Descent

## Notebook
The experiment can be found in the notebook at the root of the project.
